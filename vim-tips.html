<h1 id="toc_1">10 kick-ass Vim tips</h1>

<p>
Here are 10 Vim tips that I think you should know about (if you use Vim).
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.1">The super star and sharp</h2>

<p>
In normal mode you can use * and # to search for a word under the cursor.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
searches forward for the word, while # searches backwards.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_1.2">Simple completion in any text</h2>

<p>
Hit CTRL-N once in insert mode and it will try to complete the current word 
with the first match in the current file. CTRL-P does the same thing but 
searches backwards.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.3">The .</h2>

<p>
Type . in normal mode to repeat last change, this is super useful when doing a receptive task.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.4">The % key</h2>

<p>
You can use the % key to jump to a matching opening or closing parenthesis, 
square bracket or a curly brace. Insanely useful when programming.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.5">Indent using == and =</h2>

<p>
When working with source code it is very nice to work with indented code.
To indent the current line issue == in normal mode. Use Shift-V to go into 
visual mode, select a couple of lines and do = to indent them.
</p>

<h2 id="toc_1.6">Undo and redo</h2>

<p>
You can use u to undo the last change. CTRL-R redoes a change that has been undone. 
U returns the current line to its original state.
</p>

<p>
In Vim 7 you can use g- or g+ to go between text-states. To go to a text state 
1 minute earlier, you can use:
</p>
<blockquote>
:eariler 1m
</blockquote>
<h2 id="toc_1.7">Incremental search</h2>

<p>
There is a really neat search-option (Firefox users will love this tip). 
When you search (for example, using /), the matches will be shown while you type. 
To turn this option on, type following:
</p>
<blockquote>
set incsearch
</blockquote>
<h2 id="toc_1.8">Highlighting all the search pattern matches</h2>

<p>
To highlight all the search pattern matches in a file set the following option:
</p>
<blockquote>
:set hlsearch
</blockquote>
<p>
To disable the highlighting temporarily, use:
</p>
<blockquote>
:nohlsearch
</blockquote>
